# Trial-Repo-II-CSE-G1
Welcome to the repository for second year CSE G1 students. This repository is a platform for you to showcase your programming skills, learn from your peers, and contribute to the open-source community.

## Hacktoberfest 2023 Submissions Open!
We're thrilled to announce that this repository is now open for Hacktoberfest 2023 submissions! Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software run by DigitalOcean. It's an event where everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and earn swag in return.

This year, we're particularly interested in C programs related to problem solving and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). We believe that these areas are fundamental to any computer science student and mastering them will give you a significant edge in your future career.

Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a beginner, we welcome your contributions. This is a great opportunity to improve your coding skills, understand real-world applications of DSA, and contribute to an open-source project. Your contributions will not only benefit you, but also the thousands of students who will be using this repository for learning and reference.

To ensure quality, we request you to submit programs that are thoroughly tested and documented. Please include a brief description of the problem that your program solves, the algorithm used, and its time and space complexity.

We also encourage you to review other's submissions and provide constructive feedback. This will create a healthy learning environment and also help you understand different ways to solve a problem.
ber, the goal of
RememundefinedHacktoberfest and open-source contribution is not just about making submissions, but about learning, helping others, and making meaningful contributions. So, let's make Hacktoberfest 2023 a success together. 

We're looking forward to your contributions. Happy coding!
